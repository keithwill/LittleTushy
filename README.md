# Introduction 
Little Tushy is a websocket based client-server library meant to make it
easier to casually call and host back-end services.

# Why
There are many options for hosting or calling a backend service in .NET, but
most libraries are ambivalent about how they should be configured and incorporated
into a project.

# Features


# Getting Started
Install the nuget package and use the AddLittleTushy and UseLittleTushy extension methods.

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
